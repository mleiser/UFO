## Overview of the Analysis
  
### Purpose
   The purpose of this assignment was to code a webpage in HTML and use javascript to filter a table on the webpage using page elements.  This was done using javascript code and d3 package components.  We also used CSS for page styling.

## UFO Results
In order to perform a search, all you have to do is type the name of the city, state, country, or shape of the UFO into the bar on the left side of the page.  The search bar is pictured below.  The search bar can take inputs for each of the different boxes for multiple filters on a single search.

## UFO Summary
  One drawback for this design is that it isn't really possible to know what available data points for each search category actually are without being already familiar with the data on the table.  To remedy this, one suggestion would be to add a drop down search function that lists all the possible selections for the table and filter it on that.  Another suggestion would be to add relevent information for each of the UFO sightings come up when the search results are found such as a link to an article or something similar.
